Please provide the text you'd like me to create the podcast script from! 

Once you give me the text, I'll craft a 3-minute script with:

*  An engaging intro
*  Two hosts alternating dialogue
*  Key points from your text 
*  A natural outro
*  Short, expressive one-word interjections from one of the hosts


I'm ready to make your podcast script awesome! ðŸŽ§âœ¨
